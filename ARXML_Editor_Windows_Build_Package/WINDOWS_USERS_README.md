# ⚠️ Windows Users - Important Notice

## The Problem

The Windows executable in this release (`ARXML_Editor_Windows_v1.2.4_PyQt6_Fixed.zip`) is actually a **Linux binary** that was incorrectly built using cross-compilation. This is why you're getting the error:

> "This app can't run on your PC"

## The Solution

You need to build a proper Windows executable yourself. Don't worry - it's easy!

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

1. **Download the source code** from this repository
2. **Run the build script**: Double-click `BUILD_WINDOWS_NOW.bat`
3. **Wait for it to finish** (takes about 5-10 minutes)
4. **Find your executable**: `ARXML_Editor_Windows\ARXML_Editor.exe`

That's it! The script will handle everything automatically.

## What You Need

- **Windows 10/11** (64-bit recommended)
- **Python 3.8+** - Download from [python.org](https://python.org)
- **Internet connection** (to download dependencies)

## Why This Happened

The previous build was created on Linux using cross-compilation, which produces a Linux ELF binary that cannot run on Windows. A proper Windows PE executable must be built on Windows.

## Alternative Methods

If the simple build script doesn't work, you can also:

1. Use `build_windows_cross_platform.bat`
2. Follow the manual build instructions in `WINDOWS_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## Need Help?

- Check `WINDOWS_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed instructions
- Look at the build output for error messages
- Make sure Python is installed and added to PATH

## What You'll Get

After building, you'll have:
- A working Windows executable (~134MB)
- All dependencies bundled (no additional installation required)
- Sample ARXML files and schemas
- Complete documentation

The build process is automated and handles all the complex PyQt6 dependency issues that were causing problems before.
